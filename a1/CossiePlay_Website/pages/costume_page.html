						<h1> Welcome to the CossiePlay Costume Page</h1>
						<p> At CossiePlay we sell and make many different costumes for any event you wish to go to, from costume parties to gaming and comic book conventions.<p>
						<p> We sell used and second hand costume at a reasonable price for people who may not be able to afford some of the more expensive new costumes. Plus we can produce any costume requested, taking from a short week to make to possible a few months on a very detailed and costumed costume.</p>
						<p> <a href="../pages/custom_orders.html" target="blank">Custom Orders</a> can be done on this page, you just need to fill in some details about the costume, like measurements, costume information (genre, materials and accessories) plus a few other details. The cost and time for these costumes will vary depending on the difficulty (if its a simple outfit or a costume that requires more detail and possible multiple layers of items), materials needed and also if our production is busy. </p>
						<p> <a href="../pages/preownd.html" target="blank">Pre-Owned</a> costumes can be bought from our store at any time during the year but what is available is limited to what we have bought at the time. These costumes are cheaper then buying a new one but may have slight damages on them, but we can reapir the costumes if wished.</p>
