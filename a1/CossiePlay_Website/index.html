					<h3 class="header1">What is cosplay</h3>
					<p class="text1">If you do not know what cosplay is then this we help show you what it is. Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes, fashion accessories and outfit accessories (such as swords, guns, etc) to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any costumed role playing in venues apart from the stage. Another form of cosplay is LARP (live action role play) and re-enactments, both are very similar but the main different for these two are one is fantasy based and the other is on real battles, costumes here can be from rouges and warriors to knights and army soldiers.</p>
